<h1> Who I am</h1>

Its pretty fucken dope to be honest, even though it is a bit intimidating. Well this is me Aint I just beautiful haha <p>

  <p> As I got older I wanted to become an actress so I joined a club at school that was dedicated to writing and acting out skits. It was awesome. It was later that I realized I wanted to do work around social justice. Ive always had a passion for it I just dont know what specific profession I want. I started working for Mikva Challenge when I was a junior in high school. I joined the Juvenile Justice Council and I really fell in love with the whole thing. Mikva was amazing to me and Chris was super cool. That same year I met the love of my life, Chuy. He's my pain and my happiness. We've been together for over 3 years. ANYWAYS going back to my life, I am still pursuing a career in youth development. Reasons why I want to do are the following.

  <ol>
  <li> youth are the future of this country</li>
  <li> Our youth must be woke </li>
  <li> too many black and Latino youth are targeted by the police and people </li>
  <li> In order to fix our country we must lead our youth to success </li> 
    
    <p> We must always fight for what we believe in. People are always going to try and put us down with laws and practices that prevents us from accomplishing out goals and desires. The selfiishness and greed of these capitalists will continue until we say no more! Never give up for what you believe in even if it means Dying for it!
     QUe viva la Revolucion!!!
